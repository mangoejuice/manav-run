## Raw Notes

### Pre-race
- Did this right after traveling to Romania
- Saw some people jogging uptown as a warm-up lol
- Easy ride up on the 1
- Bag drop, it was very muddy
- Stretched out calves on the curb

### Race
- The hills were rolling
- Felt ok through the first mile
- tough through Fort Tryon Park
- Last mile hurt
- Slowed down up the hills, and recovered on the downhills parts
- Had a good sprint to the finish

### Post-race
- Had an apple


## Reflections
- Racing is really fun, I really like having spectators
- Probably should have studied the course more
    - It's kinda hard to look at the elevation and figure out how it'll feel
- Better warmup?
- funny that I'm writing this after the half, but I know more about my body now
