## Raw Notes

### Pre-race
- Woke up at 6:30
- pooped
- uber to flushing meadows
- maurten bar
- rain
- dropped off at home depot, had to walk to bag drop and back
- corrals had collapsed
- very short warmup

### Race
- first mile very crowded as usual
- slightly fast 2 and 3, was a little nervous about crashing
- kinda cramped but never bad
- no rain, just humid :( but very manageable
- mentally tough when the course had some out and backs, always looking for the turnaround
- mile 4 felt a little harder, big ramp (but not as bad as last year)
- walked for water at 4.5
- unisphere felt tedious
- prepared for the end this time
- strong finish (could've run harder?)

### Post-race
- Flushing
- felt good

## Reflections
- I'd like to learn how I react to the 10k distance more
