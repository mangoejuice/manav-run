## Raw Notes

### Pre-race
- Woke up at 6
- pooped
- subway to flushing meadows
- knees hurty all week so I was nervous
- same spot as the half, turns out I was not being paranoid (weak gloots)
- had another maurten bar, they are very sweet
- sunscreen + warmup
- corrals had collapsed before we even got there, so almost no waiting

### Race
- first mile real slow since it was crowded
- water first few water stations, dumped on neck
- felt warmed up ~2, no real knee problems
- felt a little harder around 3-4 but we were picking up the pace slightly
- lots of shade and breeze throughout, some sunny spots but they were manageable
- sent it the last mile, lost some wind around 5.5 but got through it
- there were some random uphill ramps when crossing over, but otherwise very flat
- that last part felt long
- chest starting hurting again, I think this is beacuse of overexertion in the heat
- finished with a good effort

### Post-race
- Flushing
- knee started to really hurt after a few hours

## Reflections
- race experience is good
- you know what "rough patches" are normal and what you can work through
- I am slightly more heat acclimated than I was at the half, excited to train through the summer
- my knee sucks, I am starting strength training with less volume for a few weeks
