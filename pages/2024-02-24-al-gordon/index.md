## Raw Notes

### Pre-race
- First race!
- New shoes (altra paradigm 7)
- Ubered over
- Got there a little early, it was chilly
- Streched my calves on a tree root
- I was nervous about battle pass hill
- ran with kevin

### Race
- Battle pass was completely fine, the grade was gentler than I anticipated
- shins were burning from the uphill
- hit the porta-potty after the 1 mile mark
- warmed up more through the second mile
- 3rd mile was very fun, good downhill
- small side stitch on the 4th mile, but didn't think about it since we were pretty much done
- slight uphill on center drive
- good sprint to the finish

### Post-race
- Got some coffee
- I was hype, excited to race more

## Reflections
- Racing is fun
- It's fun to run with tons of people
- Writing this way later, the first few miles are a lie
- Probably had more to say, but I'm writing this a few months late
