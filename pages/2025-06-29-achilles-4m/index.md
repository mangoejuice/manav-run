### Pre-race
- Woke up at 6:30 (pooped)
- L to N to central park
- celcius (diff flavor this time)
- porta-potty
- knee still sus, but slept well

### Race
- identical to previous day, just hot and sunny
- lots of sun while waiting
- first mile felt harder
- pretty much same race but 30 second slower pace
- stopped for water at 2 and 5k stations
- hills in mile 3 were much more manageable
- nice kick at end
