## Raw Notes

### Pre-race
- Poop at home, before start
- A little chilly getting there
- Finished stretching just in time
- Didn’t find the pacer

### Race
- First three were fast (esp 3)
- It was a little warm, starting sweating at 2
- New fuel strategy, Caff gel at start and 2, then normal ones at 4,7,10 
- That worked great, never felt like bonking
- Walked through water at 5k, then the last two gel breaks
- Lots of sun on my left 
- Nice wind on the turnaround, but also lost steam on that uphill (expected)
- Walked the water at 7, started feeling my quads (bad omen)
- probably didn’t need water at 10, I should have just taken my gel
- Hamstrings were feeling overworked, then my quads towards the end
- Wasted a couple minutes because of this and lost momentum
- Final bridge was tough, and seeing a small climb the last quarter mile was very demoralizing
- Ended up walking, big mistake since my legs were shot
- Finished in 2:16:57

### Reflections
- Overall, I was in a lot more control than Brooklyn
- Cardio was always comfortable, but I should have eased off in the first half
- I like this fueling strategy, but getting tired of Maurten (ended up holding in my mouth for a bit)
- Time to hit the gym, fell off on this
- I think I would have hit my goal if I was consistent leading up to this
