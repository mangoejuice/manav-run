## Raw Notes

### Pre-race
- Comedy of errors (no sleep, headache, water bottle open in bag)
- pooped once in the morning, once before starting

### Race
- Pace felt breezy , watch was reporting low 9s?
- penultimate mile was hard, took a while
- Nice downhill finish

### Post-race
- Toe-nails
- lost my key
