## Raw Notes

### Training
- Hal Higdon Novice 2
- Worked up to 22 miles a week, with a 12 mile long run (10:14 pace) the saturday before
- Practiced with gels and water bottle on long runs
- This went very well! My legs were fatigued but taper week helped
- Did 5 miles of running during taper, and a 45 minute walk the day before the race
- Thought I was having a right knee problem, but I was just begin paranoid
- Tried carb loading but I couldn't eat that much

### Pre-race
- Woke up around 5:15am
- Rolled my lower legs a bit in the morning to loosen them up (I think this made a difference?)
- Didn't really poop
- headed out around 6:15am
- Snagged some free Maurten 225s (very nice) the day before, had one on the train over
    - It tasted fine
- Bag-checked immediately, hit the porta-potty
- Temp was fine, felt a little too warm in the sun when I was warming up
- Had a cup of water 
- Hit the porta-potty again in the corral

### Race
- took a caff gel once the wave started
- Wave started at 8, didn't actually cross until ~8:25
- Messed up starting my Strava
- First half mile was downhill, immediately back up but felt good
- Didn't have the usual leg tightness starting off
- Grand army plaza good vibes
- Felt nice and warmed up entering the park
- Effort was slightly higher than I was expecting but wasn't too worried
- Took a gel around mile 4, ran through the sprinkler which was fun
- Took Battle Pass by effort, which felt great except...
- My chest had some weird sharp pain around the top/mile 5 which I've never had before, I got nervous and slowed down a bit
- hill-arious
- Was able to breathe through it, but still weird since I felt great otherwise (breathing easy, legs felt fine) 
- Picked it up a bit at the end of the park (mile 6 + 7), I felt really good
- Grabbed an extra gel from the table at mile 7
- Left the park feeling great, pretty confident about finishing the race strong
- Started Ocean Parkway, slight uphill to the ramp
- It was sunny and I started feeling hot
- Effort got worse over the next miles
- Took my second gel a little earlier (~8.5) than I was planning, hoped this would help
- I picked up some endurance drink from the tables
- Ended up walking a little bit after the 9 mile marker
- Figured I could just run the last 4-ish a little slower
- Couldn't get back into any good rhythm when I started running again
- Felt really hot, hit every water table and sprinkler, I was dumping water on my neck
- Walk-ran pretty much the remainder
- took the extra gel at 11
- Eked out the last 3/4 mile
- Quads were burning but I figured someone would wheel me across the finish if I collapsed
- Big effort once I passed the Cyclone
- Seeing the ocean was awesome and hyped me up
- Had a great sprint to the finish line on the boardwalk

### Post-race
- Legs were real wobbly
- Decent walk to get medals
- Streched out my quads in the recovery tent
- Met a nice guy on the line for the tent, we traded Stravas
- Picked up my bag, then left
- No appetite for a while, felt a little naseous for a while
- Legs hurty

## Reflections
- A little disappointed by the result, I really wasn't expecting to walk the race (especially that early)
- I ran the first half with a conservative pace with the intent to negative split, but maybe the effort was still a bit too high
- Late start and heat?
- I also fed into the crowd hype through the park, was fiddling with my phone (strava, music, etc.) more than I should have
    - I definitely lacked focus going onto Ocean Pkwy
- Ended negotiating with myself a lot around mile 9
    - I think I could have run a bit longer (maybe even the whole race?), but it would not have been pleasant
    - I always win my negotatiations on long runs, have to translate that to race day
- Still glad to have finished my first half marathon
- I am motivated to get stronger for the next half marathon (and races after that)
