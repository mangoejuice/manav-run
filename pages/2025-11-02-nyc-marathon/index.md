Here's how it went.

### Training and race prep
I aimed to complete an 18-week training block, mostly because this is what everyone says you should do to prepare for a marathon. Based on the people I talked to who had experienced their first marathons and lots of time online, I felt like my plan had to have a peak week of at least 50 miles. 

I also hoped to do some base building leading into the plan, but ended up not doing much. I felt burnt out from preparing for the United NYC Half, so I just ran enough to get through my scheduled 9+1 races.

Once the training block began, I used Runna to build my marathon plan. It was not for me. I had to fiddle with too many controls to get good weekly mileage, it ramped up the paces and mileage very quickly, and reacted very extremely when I tried scheduling some easier weeks for planned vacations in the block. I switched to Hanson's beginner plan, which checked a lot of boxes for me. It had great mileage (peaking at 57 a week), a reasonable ramp, and fit in conveniently with the vacations I had. Hanson's also comes with an accompanying book that explained how the plan was structured, which I found pretty convincing and a great reference as I went through training.

After switching, my adherence to the plan was very good. I pretty much did all 6 runs a week and stuck to the prescribed paces. I did make some minor adjustments, but they were very intentional and in line with the ideas in the book. I really think Hanson's did a great job of taking me from ~25 miles a week to a 57.5 peak week. I also did some strength work, but stopped around the start of September once training got hard.

I was mostly healthy, but always worried about some minor leg issue. The first few weeks started with some quad pain. This gave way to something that felt like shin splints in my right leg. These completely went away once I switched shoes, at which point I started feeling some soreness in my right ankle. The worst was a legitimate left Achilles injury after my final long run, probably since I took that one a little fast. I went to physical therapy, did the prescribed exercises, and showed up healthy on race day.

I did less running than planned during the taper because of the injury. A few days out, I started to carb load according to Featherstone's recommendation. It suggested 550 grams of carbs per day for the three days leading up to the race. I did it, but it was gross.

### Race day

I started race day with a great poop. I had a bagel, banana, and serving of Skratch carb mix for breakfast. It took almost three hours from my apartment to the start village. There was some waiting to get onto the ferry to Staten Island, and the buses from the terminal to the village took a long time. I had my second bagel on the ride over.

As an aside, I think Nike really stole the show with the ad placements all over the city. My favorite was a wrapped ferry they parked in front of the Statue of Liberty.

Since getting to the village took so long, we didn't really get that much time until the Wave 5 corrals opened. It was just enough time to use the portapotties, get undressed, and stretch. I slammed a Red Bull on the walk over to the corrals.

I stressed myself out a lot in the corral looking for the pacer, but they just entered ~5 minutes later than we did. I took a regular gel in the start about five minutes before the start. The corrals collapsed and we walked over to the start line.
