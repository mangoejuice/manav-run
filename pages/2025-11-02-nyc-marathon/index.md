## Raw Notes

### Pre-race
- great training
- good mileage
- Achilles problems a couple weeks out
- Some strength training
- Carb load was fine
- Taper was fine

### Race
- pooped well in the morning
- skratch banana and bagel
- second bagel on bus
- ferry over was good
- Shuttle took a very long time
- not much time in village
- just enough to poop, get undressed and stretch before walking over
- really stressed myself with finding the pacer
- slammed a Red Bull
- slow walk to the start, found the pacer
- gel five minutes before
- sunny start
- reasonable up the bridge
- fast down
- vibes were good though
- heart rate was high (adrenaline, caffeine, heat)
- dense as fook
- through Brooklyn was fine, though we were consistently closer to 10 minute splits
- 4th ave all blended together
- sun was in full force, heart rate was high
- Achilles maybe felt a little tight
- Took water with my gels 
- really tried to stick to the pacers shoulder, this felt fine
- I was probably putting in too much effort for this early
- I really hated the crowds
- Claustrophobic, could not focus on myself
- able to breath a bit in south Williamsburg 
- finished my first bottle here
- Bedford got crowded again
- knew where I was
- but felt weird, so dense
- thighs were starting to feel sore
- I was a little suspicious, but wanted to try running through it
- Through McCarren, station was sticky
- On Manhattan was the first time I knew something was really wrong
- kept on going, took some early nutrition before Pulaski
- queens got progressively worse, really struggled to keep with the pacer
- at the aid station before the bridge, could not catch up
- Stopped on bridge to stretch my thighs, the cramping was real
- walked up the bridge, jogged down
- hit the med tent, got a massage and biofreeze
- Gatorade and salt
- Once I started walking, it was pretty bad. My legs were fried
- slowly started jogging, and had to walk again after a short time
- thighs kept on seizing, hamstrings started going too, and calves would spasm if I landed in a certain way
- walk/ran all the way up first ave
- More salt, banana, and med tents
- Struggled into Bronx, just in lots of pain
- took lots of Gatorade
- Still followed the gel plan
- leaving Bronx, I started to jog at my easy pace
- my legs were still really bad, but not seizing in the same way anymore
- Able to maintain a very slow pace
- landing weird was dangerous, almost fell multiple times
- got some biofreeze
- walked through the last aid station, decided I needed to run until the end
- maintained a very slow pace, really toeing the line
- the pain was probably 8/10, I just had to be very mindful
- CP was my favorite crowd
- good energy, and I had space to breathe
- two miles went by quick
- turned onto cp south
- pain ratcheted up, didn't actually think I could keep on going without a break 
- turning back in was excruciating 
- fully expected to collapse in the park
- seeing the finish really revitalized me
- made it across 

### Post-race
- Long ass walk, probably a good thing
- legs calmed down a bit
