# welcome to manav.run

I talk about my races.

My goals for this blog include:
- Building a writing habit
- Figuring out [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and exploring [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/)
- Showing myself that I am improving at running

This blog is loosely inspired by some running content I enjoy ([1](https://www.youtube.com/@kofuzi), [2](https://www.youtube.com/@flobergruns), [3](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2195464.What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running)). I'd like to expand it to some of my other runs and hobbies in general.

Feel free to poke me if you know me and I haven't written anything in a while.
