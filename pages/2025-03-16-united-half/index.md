- quick through security 
- lots of time on portapotty line, ate a bar
- Corrals took a while to open
- Found the pacer let’s go

### Race
- crowded up Flatbush, thought the pacer was fast but he was on pace
- a little bit of weaving
- Didn’t notice Battle pass
- Started to sweat out of the park
- Downhill Flatbush was fun
- Rained a little, felt nice
- Turned towards the bridge
- Feet were in and out of numb (laces too tight?)
- approach to bridge was easy, views were cool
- Crowded
- ramp off bridge and small ramp up to FDR
- uneventful stretch (thought this would be worse)
- Pacer stopped for water at 6 and 9
- Turned into manhattan
- Forgot about the uphill, started getting harder after 10
- 11 and 12 took forever to find
- Didn’t notice Times Square
- Park was pain, legs really feeling it
